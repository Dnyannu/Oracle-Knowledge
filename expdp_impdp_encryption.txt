Encrypted Export

Data Pump allows the export to be done in encrypted mode. This mode allows having the encrypted columns maintained in the dump file.
There are different modes of the encryption available, i.e. dual, transparent and password.
Also, you can decide where the encryption mode should be applied;
for example, to the entire data and metadata (all), just the metadata (metadata_only) or none.

The encryption modes of dual and transparent require the Oracle Wallet to be open and available and need the compatible mode of the database to be set to 11.0.0.
The simplest mode is the password mode which needs the password to be supplied at the time of the export and the same password is needed with the import.
Failing would lead to the import's failure.  Encryption requires the Advanced Security license option.

Data Pump has the following encryption parameters:

  *  encryption:  Is used to encrypt data before writing it to the dump file and accepts five values
       <*>  all:  Enables encryption for both data and metadata of the exported objects
       <*>  data_only:  Enables encryption for only data that is exported
       <*>  encrypted_columns_only:  Enables encryption only for encrypted columns
       <*>  metadata_only:  Enables encryption of the metadata of the exported objects
       <*>  none:  Disables encryption of the data and metadata of the exported objects

  *  encryption_algorithm:  Specifies the algorithm for the encryption and accepts three algorithms:
       <*>  AES128:  The default value
       <*>  AES192
       <*>  AES256

  *  encryption_mode:  Specifies the type of security and accepts the following values:
       <*>  password:  Required to provide a password to encrypt the dump file
       <*>  transparent:  Requires a wallet to use
       <*>  dual:  Creates a dump file which might be imported using both the above mentioned modes
       <*>  encryption_password:  Is used to provide a password for the dump file and differs between Oracle 10g and 11g.
            If this parameter is used, then the encryption parameter's default value becomes ALL.
	    If both parameters are omitted, then the encryption parameter is set to NONE. 


In the following example, use all parameters to export data that is encrypted and password provided using the AES256 algorithm mode:

expdp PIHIST/pihist dumpfile=exp_dir:test.dmp logfile=exp_dir:test.log encryption=all encryption_mode=password encryption_password=test encryption_algorithm=aes256
impdp test/test remap_schema=pihist:test dumpfile=exp_dir:test.dmp logfile=exp_dir:imp.log encryption_password=test

expdp PIHIST/pihist dumpfile=exp_dir:test.dmp logfile=exp_dir:test.log encryption=all encryption_mode=password encryption_password=pass
impdp test/test remap_schema=pihist:test dumpfile=exp_dir:test.dmp logfile=exp_dir:imp.log encryption_password=pass
