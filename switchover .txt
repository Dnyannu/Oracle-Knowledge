
Task to perform Before Switchover:
1. Verify the primary database instance is open and the standby database instance is mounted.

SQL> select name,open_mode,database_role from v$database;

2. Verify there are no active users connected to the databases.
3. Make sure the last redo data transmitted from the Primary database was applied on the standby database. Issue the following commands on Primary database and Standby database to find out:

SQL>select max(Sequence#) from v$archived_log;
SQL>select max(Sequence#) from v$archived_log where applied='YES';
SQL>select sequence#, applied from v$archived_log;

 Switchover Steps
1.	On the primary database 
Connect to primary database

SQL>connect /@primary as sysdba
SQL> ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PHYSICAL STANDBY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;

2. After step 1 finishes, Switch the original physical standby database to primary role;
Open another prompt and connect to SQLPLUS:

SQL>connect /@Standby as sysdba
SQL> ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY ;

3. Immediately after issuing command in step 2, shut down and restart the former primary instance :

SQL>SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
SQL>STARTUP NOMOUNT;
SQL>ALTER DATABASE MOUNT STANDBY DATABASE;
SQL>ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_STATE_2=DEFER;
SQL>ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT  FROM  SESSION ;

4. After step 3 completes: shut down and restart the former standby instance :

SQL>SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
SQL>STARTUP;

5. On the new primary database, perform a SWITCH LOGFILE to start sending redo data to the  new standby database.

SQL>ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;

6. Make sure the redo data transmitted from the Primary database was applied on the standby database. Issue the following commands on Primary database and Standby database to find out:

SQL>select max(Sequence#) from v$archived_log;
SQL>select max(Sequence#) from v$archived_log where applied='YES';
SQL>select sequence#, applied from v$archvied_log;
